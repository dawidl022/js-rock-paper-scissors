# JavaScript Rock Paper Scissors - The Odin Project

Simple implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game in JavaScript.

The game is playable in the browser with the use of buttons. The score is
updated after each round, and the game ends once either the player on the
computer scores 5 points.
